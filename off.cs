// Assuming 'array' is a List or similar collection.
int n = array.Count; // Efficiently retrieves the number of elements in 'array'.

// If you need to perform operations based on 'n', consider using a 'for' loop or other iteration methods.
// For example, to iterate over the collection:
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
    // Access each element as 'array[i]' within this block.
}
